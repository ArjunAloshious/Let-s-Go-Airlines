                    Our fleet consists of the Boeing 747 which is a large, long-range wide-body airliner manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the United States. On September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out of the custom-built Everett Plant, the world's largest building by volume. The 747 was the first airplane dubbed a "Jumbo Jet", the first wide-body airliner. The quadjet typically accommodates 366 passengers in three travel classes. It has a pronounced 37.5° wing sweep, allowing a Mach 0.85 (490 kn; 900 km/h) cruise speed, and its heavy weight is supported by four main landing gear legs with four-wheel bogies each. The 747 has a Maximum Take-Off Weight of 833,000 lb / 377,842 kg and range of 12,000 km - 14,000 km.
